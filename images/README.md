# Images Folder

This folder should contain all the images used in the Aquamax website:

1. `product-showcase.jpg` - The main product image for the hero section
2. `video-placeholder.jpg` - The thumbnail for the video section
3. `testimonial-1.jpg` - Photo of testimonial customer 1
4. `testimonial-2.jpg` - Photo of testimonial customer 2
5. `testimonial-3.jpg` - Photo of testimonial customer 3
6. `como-funciona-2.png` - Diagram showing how Aquamax works
7. `placeholder.svg` - A generic placeholder image

Make sure to copy these images from the original project's `public` folder into this `images` folder before deploying to your web hosting service.
